                    Liquefied hydrocarbon gases (LHG) or liquefied petroleum gas
                    (Eng. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)) - a mixture of light hydrocarbons liquefied under pressure with a temperature
                    boiling point from -50 to 0 °C. Designed for use as a fuel, and also used as
                    raw materials for organic synthesis. The composition can vary significantly, the main components are: - propane; -
                    isobutane and - n-butane.

                    <p>
                    LPG is produced in the process of distillation of a wide fraction of light hydrocarbons (NGL = WSLH (wide spread of
                    light hydrocarbons) = NGL (Natural gas liquids). NGL refers to liquefied hydrocarbon gases and
                    is a low-boiling and flammable liquid, flammable and explosive, class 4
                    toxicity.
